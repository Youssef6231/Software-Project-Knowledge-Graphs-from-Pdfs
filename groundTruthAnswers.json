		"question": "How does the SAMCares system adapt to diverse learning needs?",
		"ground_truth": "The SAMCares system adapts to diverse learning needs by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to create an interactive and personalized learning experience. It allows students to ask questions, access relevant resources, and seek clarification in a chat-like environment tailored to their unique learning requirements. Additionally, the system incorporates Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide real-time, context-aware assistance, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the information provided. Users can also upload additional study materials through a web-based GUI, further customizing the support they receive.",
		"agent_answer": "The SAMCares system adapts to diverse learning needs by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer real-time, context-aware, and adaptive educational support. The system allows for an interactive and personalized learning experience where students can ask questions, access relevant resources, seek clarification, and follow personalized learning paths based on their individual needs. SAMCares can provide different levels of explanation based on the complexity of the query, ensuring that the responses cater to the user's level of understanding. Additionally, users can upload additional study materials to receive tailored responses to their queries. Overall, the system dynamically adjusts to the complexity of the content based on the form of the prompt/question asked, supporting a wide range of educational needs and learning stages."
